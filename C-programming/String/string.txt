In C programming, a string is a sequence of characters stored in 
a character array, and it is terminated by a null character ('\0').


ex-char str[] = "Hello";

'H'  'e'  'l'  'l'  'o'  '\0'

Each character is stored in one array element.
The last character '\0' tells the compiler where the string ends.

string declaration
char name[6] = {'A', 'n', 'u', 'p', '\0'};  // manual
char name[] = "Anup";              // string literal (preferred)
